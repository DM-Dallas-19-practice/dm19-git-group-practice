# Project Summary

In this project, we'll be sharing a github repo with another classmate. You'll learn to Branch, Pull and Push to a shared github repository.

## Step 1

## Summary

In this step, we'll get the project set up on two different computers.

## Instructions

Partner up with a classmate and one of you will fork and clone this repo.
Send the link to your forked github to your partner and have them clone it to their computer.
Both of you should run npm install.


## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we'll create a branch and add code to the project
### Instructions

Firstly in your terminals run git checkout -b "yourBranchNameHere".
This will create a new branch for you to add new code to your projects without affecting the master.
Once this is done, on the bottom left of your code editor you should see the name of the branch you are currently working on.

Now that you each have your own branches, both people should add a file to the components folder. Whats included in the file doesn't matter(work appropriate!).
Both should go into App.js and add their own name in between the ul tags.
After you have finshed both should add and commit their code. Then one will run git push origin nameOfBranch.



- Create Project (already been done for you)  
- Clone repository into your own project folder  
- Git checkout -b branchName  
- Yarn/NPM install  
- code...  
- Git commit  
- Git checkout to master (git checkout master)
- Git pull (checks for any other changes to master branch)  
- Git checkout branchName  
- Git merge master (merge any updates to your branch)  
- Yarn/npm i to check for new packages  
- Check for any conflicts.  
- No conflicts then git commit/push origin branchName  
- Create Pull request
- Slack (mentor name here) the link to the pull request
- (mentor name here) will double check for any conflicts and then merge  
- (mentor name here) will send a message to the group confirming merge
- Checkout back to master and pull again 
- Checkout back to branchName and merge master  
- Repeat from 'Yarn/NPM install'
